I do all the code stuff for the game, and I made this site as well! If you want to see this site's code you can check it out <a href="https://github.com/Yin4TheWin/nnmg-site">here</a> on Github. I'm still pretty new to React, so feedback would be appreciated: hit me up at yin4thewin@gmail.com.<br/><br/>Other reasons to hit me up include questions about the game, loneliness, boredom or literally anything. We're also always open for new programmers, writers, voice actors or artists, so let me know about that too!</Typography>

If there are any queries or criticisms of the game, please ask someone else. They are solely responsible for 5% of the plot, and not actually programming.

            If you have questions about the game or its dev process, this is also where I'll likely respond the quickest. Here's the link to join: <a href="https://discord.gg/RUZNp3r">https://discord.gg/RUZNp3r</a>.

            Unfortunately we are unable to offer financial compensation at this time. Additionally I cannot guarantee that we will generate any revenue, much less profit.

And if we ever do make money, know that you will definitely be compensated accordingly.

              QA/Beta Testers are an indispensable part of any good dev team. They catch bugs, point out loopholes and generally offer the feedback necessary to make a great game a reality. I haven't worked out the specifics yet, but I'm currently thinking of implementing a "drops" system where users active on the devblog/Discord can get access to early release builds. A user's activity can be measured by them creating an account on this site that is also linked to their Discord account (hence the log in button in the navbar).
              While logged in, views and comments on the Devblog will contribute to that user's drop chances. I'll update this later when I work it all out, but in the meantime feel free to join the <a href="https://discord.gg/RUZNp3r">Discord</a> to stay tuned!
