const text="##Who Are We? \nGlad you asked (or if you didn't ask, glad you're reading)! NNMG (pronounced Nunmeg), or No Name Makes Games, Studios is composed of a small group of college students passionate about gaming, art and storytelling. While we do have a name, we call ourselves \"No Name\" because we believe it's the quality of the game, not the name of its maker, that counts (BS Translator: We couldn't think of a name). Plus, Nunmeg is fun to say. Read on to learn about the people on the team, the game we're currently working on and how you can receive updates or become a beta tester for the game.  \n"
