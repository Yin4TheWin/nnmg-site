const text="At the moment, Quixotic Quest is a traditional, turn-based RPG. But what if we could put a spin on this genre? What if we looked at two beloved game genres, took the best of both worlds (with a heavier emphasis on RPG) and tried to make something new out of it?  \n  \n"+

"A MOBA, or Multiplayer Online Battle Arena, is an online game where players compete against each other in two teams. Each player controls a character with a set of spells, which improve over the course of the game. Some successful MOBAs today include League of Legends, DOTA 2, Smite and Heroes of the Storm.  \n   \n"+
"###Plus RPG...  \n   \n"+
"An RPG, or Role Playing Game, is typically a single player game in which players assume the role of a character in a fictional world. They then act out the character's epic quest, usually to save the world. The RPG genre is quite massive, and expands outside of video games to include tabletop (D&D) and live action (LARPing) as well.  \n   \n"+
