const text="At the moment, Quixotic Quest is a traditional, turn-based RPG. But what if we could put a spin on this genre? What if we looked at two beloved game genres, took the best of both worlds (with a heavier emphasis on RPG) and tried to make something new out of it?  \n  \n"+
"##The Equation  \n   \n"+
"---  \n   \n"+
"###Moba...  \n   \n"+
"A MOBA, or Multiplayer Online Battle Arena, is an online game where players compete against each other in two teams. Each player controls a character with a set of spells, which improve over the course of the game. Some successful MOBAs today include League of Legends, DOTA 2, Smite and Heroes of the Storm.  \n   \n"+
"###Plus RPG...  \n   \n"+
"An RPG, or Role Playing Game, is typically a single player game in which players assume the role of a character in a fictional world. They then act out the character's epic quest, usually to save the world. The RPG genre is quite massive, and expands outside of video games to include tabletop (D&D) and live action (LARPing) as well.  \n   \n"+
"###Equals?  \n   \n"+

"...well, that. Not quite sure what to call it, but here are some key features the finished product should have:  \n  \n"+
"- Fighters have four unique spells, which can be activated by pressing Q, W, E or R  \n  \n"+
"- Fighters also can use two out of a large pool of shared spells, bound to T and Y  \n  \n"+
"- Not strictly turn-based, characters can perform an action whenever their action bar fills up instead  \n  \n"+
"- Also gain gold and experience per second which is used to buy items and level up your skills<ul/>  \n  \n"+
"##Logistics  \n  \n"+
"---  \n  \n"+
"The progression of the game would inevitably differ from that of a traditional RPG. The power level of each character will pretty much be determined from the start, because characters power up in battle but reset afterwards. Progression, then, must largely be driven by the plot or the unlock of new characters, spells or augments in some kind of augment system.  \n  \n"+
"The idea is still in its early stages, and I'm not sure whether to make the switch or stick with a traditional turn-based system. I'll post more updates as development on this progresses, both conceptually and technologically. In the meantime, join the Discord or shoot me an email (yin4thewin@gmail.com) to be notified of updates!  \n  \nUntil next time, YinFTW"
