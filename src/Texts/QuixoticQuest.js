const text="##Quixotic Quest  \nWe're making Quixotic Quest, an RPG game in which, unlike other RPGs, you try to save the world. Yoapan's being torn apart by the Black Hand, and its up to you to beat them, as only heroes can. \"Quixotic\" comes from the Spanish novel \"Don Quixote\" and means idealistic, unreal or impractical. We want this to be the tone of our game: fun and lighthearted, like a dream, but not afraid to take itself seriously at times. There's a demo available on itch, which you can view here: https://yin4thewin.itch.io/quixoticquest  \n  \nThe demo ends when you fight the guards at the royal palace. To enter the royal palace you must complete Sans' quest and obtain \"Road block repellent\". Sans is located in a secret garden near the start of the game. The quest \"Glitch in the Matrix\" can be completed but you will not receive any rewards yet, this is intentional. Additionally, the glitched portal can not be entered yet. I'm still working on that dungeon.  \n  \nHere are some images and videos from the current demo:"
